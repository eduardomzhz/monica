MÃ³nica's feed tracking app made with Cordova and Vue

Was having problems with my baby's feeding, so I made this small app to keep a track of her daily feed schedule and behavior.

I only uploaded the `src/` folder that contains all the app code and the configuration I use to build it into a `www/` folder of my cordova project.
